Whoa... Just walked out of Squad 36. My head's buzzing like a beehive with bass speakers. You know that feeling when you’re still half in the  ? Reality's kinda glitchy. Even had some popcorn shells stuck in my teeth—always happens. The theater seats felt like sitting on concrete, my back's protesting hard, it's like… like it was handpicked by torturers. 

The opening scene drowned in neon, like a '90s fever dream, probably where I lost half my sanity right there. Think the noise was just pouring outta the screen, like a waterfall with speakers, you know? Some dudes behind me whispered like they were plotting a heist. But the action? Exploded like birt𝘏𝘋ay cakes in zero gravity. Felt unreal.

> Can't lie, I completely forgot who first asked me if I’d 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , but yeah, this one's definitely a keep-in-my-pocket kinda 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮. Worth another 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩—maybe on a quieter day when my brain stops vibrating. Still, those squad members moved like chess pieces in a game manipulated by a drunken octopus high on espresso.

Midway through, that plot twist 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ed in like a misplaced tap dance in a 𝘭𝘪𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘳𝘺. I think I even forgot to breathe. Reminded me of when you open a can of soda and it just fizzes everywhere. Bodies flying around, reminded me of a kinetic sculpture I saw once, while someone pounded piano keys in the background, but I think it was just my imagination. Oh, and that villain! Dripping charisma like a 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬y faucet, every word like syrup sliding off a pancake stack. 

Remember to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   under a cozy blanket next time; it's like trying to ride a rollercoaster in a snowstorm without one. Someone just scattered popcorn all over the floor, a crunchy carpet beneath my feet, like that sandpaper we used back in art class.

Anyway, before I lose my mind completely—what was I saying? Yeah, remember that one scene where they’re all like during the raid and—oh, look! A squirrel...
